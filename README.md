# pico-step

Use this code base to operate a step motor on a Pico Pi W.

This code (and diagram.json) is intended to be used with [wokwi](https://wokwi.com/)

## Task 1

1. Go to the wokwi.com page and start a new project.

2. Copy the contents of the diagram.json from this repo to the project.

3. Examine the diagram and observe the connections between pins and devices.

4. Use the code from step.py to move the motor in one direction.

## Step 2

1. Add a button to the system.

1. Modify the code to start/stop turning the motor when the button is pressed.

## Task 3

1. Expand the code by connecting to a WiFi network.

2. Ensure the Pi will send a UDP notification to any IP address stating the motor has started or stopped.
